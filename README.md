# illumination_repairs

App for booking repairs and contact

A demonstration piece (as no one would download an app just to get one item repaired). It uses tabs for navigation
Shows a video on the front (home) page/tab, has an email enquiry form which sends an email to a static email
address on tab 2/email  and has email and weblinks on tab 3/website - to be honest, the email link on the third tab
is un-necessary as it doubles up on the one on tab 2 but I have left it in as I will use this app to use sections of it in future 
(more commercial) apps.
